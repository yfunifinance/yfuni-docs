# UNICORN Token

**UNICORN** \(Ecosystem Token on YFUNI Finance\) 

With an initial circulating supply of only 5,000,000 tokens, which varies in available supply based on how many tokens are deposited to or removed from the staking or farming contract, UNICORN will be one of the easiest and most profitable coins to invest in and hold. Since UNICORN works on a deflationary model and using BaB Mechanism, token supply will continue being decreased as time goes on.
