# uGov

**YFUNI holders can participate in YFUNI evolution through governance.**

This governance model is a first of its kind and allows for cost free voting thatâ€™s publicly verifiable by YFUNI holders. To facilitate a healthy ecosystem, YFUNI incorporates a unique on-chain voting mechanism that will introduce flexible voting parameters. Users will be able to vote for the launch of new pools \(new tokens, different lock-up periods, etc.\) or vote for many proposals related to future developments within the YFUNI ecosystem

**Governance Website: Coming Soon...**

To be implemented between Q2 2021 on YFUNI Ecosystem. \(See [Roadmap](https://app.gitbook.com/@yfuni-finance/s/yfuni-finance/protocol/roadmap)\)
