# uSwap

It's an automated market maker \(AMM\) enabling single-sided liquidity and impermanent loss \(IL\) mitigation. uSwap creates decentralized trading pools \(similar to Pancake Swap\), which traders can buy or sell from.

To be implemented between Q4 2021 on YFUNI Ecosystem. \(See [Roadmap](https://app.gitbook.com/@yfuni-finance/s/yfuni-finance/protocol/roadmap)\)
